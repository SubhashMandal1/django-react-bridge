## Overview

`django-react-bridge` is intended to be the **minimal boilerplate** you need to:

- Perform authenticated HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) against a Django REST API  
- Automatically attach JWT tokens (or any bearer token) to outgoing requests  
- Offer transparent request retry mechanisms for transient failures  
- Provide an optional in-memory caching layer to reduce redundant network calls  

Whether your React application is built with Create React App, Next.js, or any other bundler, this package aims to keep your frontend code concise and focused on renderingâ€”while it handles the plumbing of communicating with Django.

  - Built-in retry logic for network or 5xx errors.  
  - Configurable number of retries and backoff strategy.  

- **Simple In-Memory Caching**  
  - Optional caching layer keyed by endpoint URL + query params.
